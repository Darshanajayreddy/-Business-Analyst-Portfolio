# -Business-Analyst-Portfolio
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This space is dedicated to showcasing my work as a business analyst, demonstrating my ability to bridge the gap between business needs and technical solutions. I specialize in requirements elicitation, data analysis, process mapping, and delivering insights that drive strategic decisions.
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects that highlight my skills in:

Data Analysis & Visualization: Utilizing tools like Python (Pandas), SQL, and Tableau to transform complex datasets into clear, actionable insights.

Requirements Management: Documenting and prioritizing functional and non-functional requirements to ensure project success.

Process Modeling: Creating detailed workflow diagrams (e.g., BPMN) to identify inefficiencies and propose optimized processes.

Stakeholder Communication: Translating technical concepts for business audiences and articulating business needs to development teams.
